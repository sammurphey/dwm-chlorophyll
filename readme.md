I don't recommend using this build as is for your main wm as it's not set up to 
recieve updates from DWM. Instead please install a up-to-date version of [DWM 
from Suckless](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and then copy my [config.h file] into 
it's installation directory. After updating the configs you'll need to run `make` 
again to compile with the new settings.
